  People need homes: children assume their parents‘ place as home; boarders call school ’home‘ on weekdays;
married couples work together to build new homes;
and travelers … have no place to call 'home', at least for a few nights.
So how about people who have to travel for extended periods of time? Don’t they have the right to a home? Of course they do.
Some regular travelers take their own belongings: like bed sheets, pillowcases and family photos to make them feel like home
no matter where they are; some stay for long periods in the same hotel and as a result become very familiar with service
and attendants; others may simply put some flowers by the hotel window to make things more homely. Furthermore, driving
a camping car during one’s travels and sleeping in the vehicle at night is just like home – only mobile!
And how about maintaining relationships while in transit? Some keep contact with their friends via internet;
some send letters and postcards, or even photos; others may just call and say hi, just to let their friends know
that they're still alive and well. People find ways to keep in touch. Making friends on the way helps travelers
feel more or less at home. Backpackers in youth hostels may become very good friends, even closer than siblings.
Nowadays, fewer people are working in their local towns, so how do they develop a sense of belonging? Whenever
we step out of our local boundaries, there is always another 'home' waiting to be found. Wherever we are,
with just a little bit of effort and imagination, we can make the place we stay "home".
